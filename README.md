=================================================================================================================

The initial steps of a mobile CSS framework for the most common UI patterns found in the now discontinued Aetna's 
CarePass mobile app. Unfortunately, with the dawn of Apple's HealthKit, Aetna terminated the project (http://venturebeat.com/2014/08/26/failure-of-aetnas-carepass-platform-might-be-a-bad-omen-for-apple-healthkit-and-others/)
and it was never taken beyond this early development stage.
